## Tox Secrets

### Tox write to the Blackstaff Tower in his book:

We have discovered and ancient ruins in the Wood of Sharp Teeth with a camp of searchers for the Lost City of Velhar. We uncovered and dispatched an infernal servant of Asmodeus, but it was unclear to what of the Lord of Lies plots she was attempting to advance.

Interesting update on the Emerald Circle that the are being treated as "forceful guests" and they have moved underground, which seems to reference the alliance with the Underdark circle has turned, the actual message reached from the Archdruid of Selune:

_"We are forceful guests treated well but less so with time circle slowly overtaken But defended ask the forest grove protected underground no clouds"_

The arcane scholar the we have befriended has indicted that he is trying to blow up the "Hallway of Gates" that he has heard has gates to different planes of existence. Perhaps this hallway might be a chance to bring forward the "third resurrection".

No update on the Verdant Rot.

Any update on the search for information on the "Blood of the Moon"? **Blood of the Moon** might be the key to gain entrance to the Velharr

## Log

- The sub rises on a day full of awkwardness within the camp

	- Looks to smooth over some of the issues within Camp Awkward
	- Wants to search [[Syra]]'s tower for information about [[Asmodeus]]'s plans
- [[Deyrin Tox|Tox]]
	- Sends the following message to the druids:
		- _Firefox found friends; we have camp in the ruins; signal your location via the clouds and we will vector you in 	- stay frosty_
	- [[Kathay]] describes the archdruid as an aggressively red headed half-elf with shaggy red beard who dresses more like a follower of the [[Oakfather]] in a palette of reds and greens
	- The return answer:
	- _We are forceful guests treated well but less so with time circle slowly overtaken But defended ask the forest grove protected underground no clouds_
- [[Draven]] lays out his 3 major priorities
	1. Finding [[Velharr]] and establishing a camp
	2. Returning to [[Candle Keep]] to see if the battle still rages there and assist if possible
	3. Find ways to push back against the war of aggression by [[Amn]]
[[Brynna Ironpot|Brynna]] tells us how [[Varin Dustclaw|Varin]] came into the group of [[Malar]] shifters and splinters
- We send [[Kassia]], [[Kathay]] and [[Raven]] are tasked with:
	- Finding the Selune druids
	- Determining what they mean by underground
	- Determine who is holding them
- [[Deyrin Tox|Tox]] with the help from [[Osta]] rolls a _nat 20_ on his investigation roll for searching [[Syra]]'s tower

	- [[Deyrin Tox|Tox]] **blesses** [[Jasper]]'s work to determine if the **Philter of Love** was used on him, but the answer was inconclusive
- [[Jasper]] asks [[Alaric Coldbrew|Alaric]] if he knows if there is a Beholder in the Wood, but he does not think that it is likely but reminds [[Jasper]] that the best place to find one would be in the [[Hall of Gates]]
- [[Velharr]]'s outline can be scene on the

#### Legend Lore dump from the Blade Singers

- 390 DR: Foundation of Myth Lharast
	- Myth Lharast was established in Amn as a sanctuary for devout followers of Selûne, the Moonmaiden. The city was protected by a mythal—a powerful magical barrier—crafted by non-elven people, which was unusual for such enchantments. Circa 700s DR: Rise of Vehlarr
		- Vehlarr, a natural werewolf and accomplished sorcerer favored by the deities Malar and Sehanine, unified the werewolf packs in the Wood of Sharp Teeth, founding a city that bore his name.
- Pre-712 DR: Syri Mhaal's Manipulation of the Mythal
	- Syri Mhaal, one of the creators of Myth Lharast's mythal, altered it to attract benevolent lycanthropes, aiming to build a lycanthropic army to conquer the Shoon Imperium. This modification led to conflicts with Vehlarr, whose followers were drawn to the city against their will.
- 712 DR: Construction of the Circle of Vehlarr
	- With the assistance of the deity Sehanine, Vehlarr began constructing the Circle of Vehlarr, a magical portal designed to facilitate an assault on Myth Lharast.
- 720 DR: Assault on Myth Lharast and Divine Intervention
	- Vehlarr and his werewolf army utilized the Circle of Vehlarr to invade Myth Lharast. The city's defenses proved formidable, leading to intense battles. Angered by the warfare in a city partly dedicated to her, Selûne intervened, unleashing lightning bolts from the moon that obliterated Myth Lharast. The destructive energies cascaded through the portal, resulting in the destruction of Vehlarr as well.
- Post-720 DR: Myths and Legends
	- Legends suggest that both cities were transported to another plane where aging does not occur. On nights of a full moon, the city of Vehlarr is rumored to return to Abeir-Toril, accessible through the Circle of Vehlarr. However, these accounts remain unsubstantiated
- [[Jasper]] realized that the **Blood of the Moon** might be useful to gain entrance to the city
- [[Draven]] asks [[Fen]] if he can help to take us to the glade to that they were in
	-[[Fen]] is put out by [[Draven]]'s actions while he was under [[Syra]]'s influences and requires [[Osta]] to make the same suggestion
- The blade singers mention to us are setting up "teleportation dead zones" that make the use of teleportation much more risky in the Sword Coast
- [[Jasper]] uses **Flash of Genius** to boast [[Deyrin Tox|Tox]]'s roll on a survival check to 19 and we uncover a random entrance to the [[Underdark]]
- We run into a dead end and [[Osta]] closes his eyes and prays to the [[Silvanus]] and disappears through a gate to the glade of the Treant.
- [[Osta]] convince the [[Pale Oak]] and the Dryads to let the rest of us into the glade
- [[Draven]] asks the [[Pale Oak]] about the land about beyond the bridge and the [[Pale Oak]] says if the Oak Father wanted you to know about it he would show you
- [[Deyrin Tox|Tox]] asks about the Mycelia Network but neither the [[Pale Oak]] nor the Dryads know what he is talking about
	- He does spy a small piece of the Verdant Rot touching the boulders here
- [[Osta]] tries to go to the glade beyond the bridge but is stopped the Dryads saying, "You cannot proceed. You are unclean. You are but a seedling"
- [[Pale Oak]] agrees to take us to [[Velharr|the lost city of Vehlar]] and [[Draven]] and [[Deyrin Tox|Tox]] climb into his brances
- [[Jasper]] looks to the piece of the [[Verdant Rot]] to see how it effects him
	- He senses satisfaction that the mycelial network has taken root
	- He declines to climb on [[Pale Oak]] as he doesn't want to potentially effect him
	- [[Pale Oak]] tells him that you are quite small you should ride
	- [[Fen]] gets him to ride on him
